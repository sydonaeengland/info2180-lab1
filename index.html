    <h2>Sydonae England</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Sydonae England, and I’m from St. Andrew, Jamaica. 
        My love for technology began at age 10 when I received a book 
        called Over 1000 Fantastic Science Facts, sparking my curiosity 
        about inventions. With the support of inspiring IT teachers, my 
        passion for the field grew. I also enjoy swimming and pass that 
        on by teaching kids how to swim. This past summer, I had the chance 
        to explore different areas of technology, and web development stood 
        out to me. It perfectly blends creativity and problem-solving, 
        allowing me to design visually appealing, functional websites that 
        bring ideas to life. I’m currently studying Computer Science at the 
        University of the West Indies and look forward to specializing as a 
        software developer.
